---=== project 1: title tbd! ===---



====ON PAGE LOAD====

background:
    black, within 2s "spotlight" beams (low opacity white beams, potentially gradient) turn on from top of screen (almost like stage lights) - NO fade in
        - possible to have fog rolling across bottom of screen?
title:
    above center screen, appears 2s after "spotlights" turn on (in same manner as lights)
    illuminated from behind
game description:
    appears centered under the title, same manner as title but 2s delay after title pops
        - " description " (something along the lines of, 'Each round you'll hear 10s of a song and have to guess the artist ___' etc)
            - get 10 right, win the game
'begin' button:
    fades in underneath the title, add click effect(similar to what was shown during last lesson)


====BEGIN BUTTON CLICKED====

background:
    (1s after Begin click)
    spotlights turn off
    title shifts to top of page, scales to half size and centers
    description fade out
visual:
    1s later timer pops up (fades in) to count down from 5
answer ticker:
    square in top right fades in same time as 'timer'
    "SCORE:" text above square
    analog number ticks up as correct answer is selected, nothing happens if wrong answer selected


====GAME BEGIN====

album cover:
    cover corresponds with song from artist
    appears above center (pixelated? blurred?)
    has slight border, glowing white from behind
    over the course of 10s, image gets clearer (becomes fully clear after 13s OR 1s after answer selection is made)
    when new 'question' loads, album cover just replaced with slight pulse animation
song:
    figure out spotify api!
    very quick fade in/fade out(possible?)
    plays for 10s regardless of if answer selection is made
answer options:
    4 will appear simultaneous to album art/song changing
    2x2, slightest 'pulse' animation from center of 4 options 
        - as though each selection is pulsing towards opposing corners
    when selection is hovered, (low opacity) glow over button
        - correct answer selected: button color turns yellow
        -incorrect answer: button turns red
